My 27th year didn’t quite start out the way I had hoped - I mean, who wants to spend their birthday alone in bed with tonsillitis?

So thank God for social media and messengers, which made my day more interesting as friends wished me a happy birthday and responded to my birthday request: A list of tasks to complete in the next year. Sort of like a bucket list, only compiled by other people and hopefully without any bucket kicking at the end of it.

The final list is as follows:

1. Organize a Buffy Marathon with food and guests
2. Go bungee jumping
3. Read 5 books that don’t sound interesting to me at all at first glance
4. Read all the Skulduggery Pleasant books
5. Read all the Rivers of London books
6. Donate a hot meal to a homeless person
7. Visit an Escape Room
8. Give flowers to 10+ strangers on the street
9. Go horse riding
10. [Have tonsils removed](/en/quest/quest-10)
