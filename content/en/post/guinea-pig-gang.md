Guinea pigs are a big part of my life. I have seven of them, which is a lot for a one-bedroom flat and while I definitely think that when it comes to guinea pigs, more really is merrier, I never actually planned to have quite so many in my current living situation. So I wanted to write a bit about how that happened.

## The twins

I was worried that no-one would buy them for the same reason I was hesitant to - the dang 

The flat I am currently living in was my Mum’s flat while she lived in Germany. When I first moved in, I had only one guinea pig. Bobbie was the last surviving member of the guinea pig family I started as a teenager and I am ashamed to admit that I waited far too long to find new playmates for her after Muffin died (guinea pigs should never be kept alone except for medical reasons).

So anyway, as soon as I was living alone - I think it was actually the very day my Mum moved back to Scotland - I contacted a breeder looking for a baby girl to keep Bobbie company. I also ordered a fancy multi-story cage which was enormous compared to what I had had before.

When I told the breeder about Bobbie, she recommended I get two young guinea pigs rather than just one because a teenager was likely to get on Bobbie’s nerves if she had no-one else to play with. So I did that - Raven, a black and red Abyssinian, moved in that very day, and her brother Peter, a black Roan Abyssinian, joined the group a few weeks later once he had been neutered.

The three of them were, I think, quite happy together, but after about a  year, Bobbie, who was six or so, started to fade. I initially thought that she was simply getting old and it didn’t occur to me that her condition might be treatable, so I didn’t take her to the vet’s until it was too late. A short while later she died in my arms.

That was three years ago.

## The new generation

Last summer I started looking out for more guinea pigs because while Peter and Raven were both healthy, I knew that sooner or later one of them would die and I wanted to make sure ahead of time that the surviving partner wouldn’t be left alone.

In September, I found a group of three guinea pigs - two females and a male - on Ebay Kleinanzeigen. The owner was unable to keep them because of allergies. The male hadn’t been neutered out of ignorance; apparently the owner had asked the person she had bought them from at what age they could reproduce and he had replied “six months”.

Possibly this was a simple misunderstanding. Guinea pigs should not reproduce until they are almost fully grown because teenage pregnancies can be dangerous, both for the mother and the babies. Ideally, a female’s first pregnancy should happen when she is between 6 and 12 months old. But they CAN reproduce within a few weeks of being born.

Anyway. I was looking at two females which I knew might be pregnant. On the pictures I could see that they were being kept in a far too small cage filled with cat litter and were being fed nothing but dry food - they didn’t even have hay. This is the guinea pig equivalent to eating nothing but Mc Donald’s burgers. I was also worried that no-one would buy them for the same reason I was hesitant to - potentially huge vet bills - and could almost see the beautiful darlings being fed to snakes because no-one else wanted them.

My decision was probably fuelled more by emotions than by common sense, but I bought them - not just the females, but the male, too.

## The “X-Meeris”

Peter and Raven had been named after the X-Men characters Quicksilver and Mystique, and A. and I decided to stick to the pattern. I didn’t even have to think about a name for the bright red female. She was Jean from the moment I decided to adopt her. Her male companion, a white Abyssinian with brindled patches over his eye and on his back, was named Logan (Wolverine). I initially picked the name “Marie” (Rogue) for the third guinea pig, a mostly white Sheltie, but A. thought that “Ororo” (Storm) would be more fitting because of her long, white hair. We eventually agreed to call her Rory, as an abbreviation of Ororo.

All three were underweight and their claws looked like they had never been clipped, but other than that, they were healthy. Logan was immediately separated from the rest and had his first trip to the vet the following week. Because male guinea pigs can still have living sperm “in the pipe” for up to six weeks after being neutered, he had to stay by himself until the six weeks were up.

By this time, A. and I had finished building their new enclosure. Three meters long and two stories high, it takes up a huge chunk of my flat. The five of them moved in there in November of last year and I began to call the group the “X-Meeris” - a combination of “X-Men” and “Meerschweinchen”, the German word for guinea pig.

## Two groups

At the beginning, it seemed as though the group of two males and three females would work. Peter didn’t seem at all interested in picking a fight, and since Logan was only a third of his size, I thought he would probably accept Peter as his boss. But he didn’t. Several times I saw him pounce on Peter from behind, and Peter was so stressed by this behaviour that it made him physically ill.

Eventually, I had no choice but to separate them. I put Rory in the top part of the enclosure with Peter and Raven, since the whole point of getting more guinea pigs had been so they would no longer be by themselves, and Jean and Logan in the bottom part. And then I started looking for another female.

I soon found her. Amara (Magma) was six weeks old. White and dark gray, with pale yellow markings on one side of her face and dark eyes which appeared red in certain lights, she was completely gorgeous. Since she had been living with only her mother for the previous few weeks, I also thought it was safe to assume she wasn’t pregnant.

I was wrong.

## The stowaway

A month after Mara joined the group, I came home between work and band practice to check on my babies. I hurriedly gave them fresh food and water and was in the process of chucking in some hay, when something in the far corner of the bottom part of the enclosure caught my eye. I stopped what I was doing and stared in amazement at the tiny gray bundle of fur that was gawking right back at me.

I immediately gave the wee thing a checkup. It was a female, thank goodness, grayish brown with some orange and white and with bright red eyes. She weighed only 72g.

I also gave Mara a checkup. She was less pear-shaped than before and the hard lumps in her belly which I had previously felt and which had worried me exceedingly were gone. I had had visions of miscarriages and of six little boys who would need a home. I cannot find words to describe my relief that she had given birth to a single female and was feeding her. I was euphoric.

Obviously, I never made it to band practice.

## How things are now

The baby, who is called Rachel (Prestige) but whom I usually refer to as Mini, is living with the other group now because I was worried that Rory might be bored, being the only young one in a group of adults. All seven of them are happy and healthy, though Jean and Mara are still rather skittish.

You might wonder how I sleep, with seven guinea pigs in my bedroom, but the truth is, I prefer to be with A., anyway. I think we will eventually move in together, but since we both have too much stuff and he has a dust allergy, we are sticking with the slightly impractical two-flat solution for now.
