Yesterday, I deactivated my Twitter account. I don’t know yet if this is going to be permanent or if I’m going to want to reactivate it before the 30 days are up; but I do know that right now, I need to take care of myself. And I can’t do that if I’m spending lots of time every day scrolling through social media and getting worked up about anything that triggers me - and lots of things trigger me. I particularly hate it when somebody is condescending and mean, and unfortunately, my knee-jerk reaction to this is to also be condescending and mean. I need to work really hard to be non-confrontational, and often I fail.

Sometimes, it’s worth it. I love arguments online that basically end with both sides having a better understanding of the other and parting in peace, even if neither side actually changed their opinion and so I sort of feel that by leaving Twitter, I am also losing valuable insights into other people’s lives. While I believe my political views to be well thought out, I also believe that they can and should change when I receive new information and that it is important to be exposed to other people’s opinions so that I can improve my own. I know that I am privileged, and I have followed PoC and trans people on Twitter so that I can learn from them how to be a better person and a better ally. I feel like I am abandoning them by leaving.

My partner has said several times that he doesn’t think Twitter is the right place to have important conversations. He may be right. The people I am most likely to get into arguments with on Twitter are trolls rather than people who are actually interested in why I think the way I do and by engaging with them, I am am doing more harm to myself than good to anyone else.

I believe that everyone would profit from a more open and accepting society and that the capitalist nightmare we live in can become a utopia if we work together instead of lashing out at each other. And I believe that to achieve this, we need to talk to each other, be kind to each other and learn from each other. But for the next 29 days, I am going to try and do that offline.
