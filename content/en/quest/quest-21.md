*Set by Moeopman*

I completed quest #21 by going to the 35C3 in Leipzig.

There was a lot to see. Besides the assemblies and the talks, there were workshops on everything from using git to lock-picking. There was a steam-punk insect with a gas mask for a face which crawled in a circle. There was a kids area with enormous lego blocks. And there was the lounge, with the Fairydust in it.

Not everything that happened at the 35C3 was great, but on the whole I had a really good time. I didn't contribute much, but I had a lot of fun and had some fantastic experiences. Before going, I had been warned about sensory overload, but I actually felt quite at home. The 35C3 was everything I love about the Binary Kitchen, only much, much bigger.

I am looking forward to 36C3, where I plan on being an angel.
