Hello World,

this repository is for the blog which I never seem to get around to setting up because I want to do it properly. Currently, it just contains articles. Well, *one* article, but I intend to remedy that.

At some point I may or may not build a website on which to publish these articles. Currently I am considering Hugo, hence the Markdown.
