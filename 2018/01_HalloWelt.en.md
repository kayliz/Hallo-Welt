Hello World, we need to talk.

I know I don't normally say much, but there's something I need to get off my chest.

I was recently in a car with two acquaintances, listening to a news report about Donna Strickland on the radio. She had just been announced as the third woman ever to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, and the reporters were talking about the fact that, just a few months before, she had been denied an article on Wikipedia because she was not deemed important enough, and wondering whether this development might increase public recognition of female scientists.

"But there *are* hardly any female physicists," one of my companions said dismissively, disregarding the fact that, prior to receiving the Nobel Prize, Donna Strickland had clearly been given less credit for her work than her male colleagues. "*That's* the reason why so few women win the Nobel Prize."

"Yes, but the low percentage of women in science is caused by society," I replied. "We're taught from a very young age that Physics is a male discipline."

My asscociate grudgingly allowed that society *might* play a small part, but insisted that at least 80% of the cause was the biological difference between men and women. "Women think differently - that's a biological fact, and not a problem caused by society."

I was beginning to get irritated. Aren't scientists primarily driven by their curiosity? By the need to answer questions like "Why, how does it work, what can I do with it?"

That curiosity is inherent in every human being. It is not stronger in men than in women. Yes, there are biological differences between men and women, and I don't deny that that influences the way we think; but why on earth should that be the primary reason why there are so few female physicists? How is approaching problems differently a disadvantage?

"Go out, ask people," he said. "Women just aren't interested in science."

Oh, the irony. If I hadn't been so angry, I might have found it amusing - because *there* was the problem with society I was referring to. Right there.

"Women aren't interested in science."

This was his observation after nearly thirty years on this planet. He didn't mean to be condescending, but then again, one doesn't have to, to cause damage.

"Women aren't interested in science" might sound harmless to him, but do you know what a child would hear? A young girl who is still learning how the world works?

"Women aren't interested in science" - That's a fact, that's simply the way it is. Women aren't interested in science. Women *shouldn't be* interested in science.

"Women aren't interested in science" is closely related to "That's not for girls" and "Look, we have a dollhouse, wouldn't you rather play with that?"

What a load of crap.

Quite apart from the fact that, to this day, I cannot comprehend why anyone would prefer playing with dolls to assembling a model of the Millennium Falcon, making a maglev out of lego-shaped fridge magnets or play-fighting with wooden swords: What gives anyone the right to tell me what I should or shouldn't be interested in?

And yet it's crap which influenced me, which pushed me in a certain direction. It's crap which I've heard so often that, for a while, I stopped noticing how ridiculous it was. It's crap which I believe has most likely influenced everyone I know in some way, and which may be so deeply ingrained in their subconsciences that they, too, have discriminated against someone because of these alleged facts.

My heart bleeds for the next generation of girls whose scientific curiosity is discouraged and who lose all interest in it through droning lectures in a teacher-centred school system. Girls who are told:

Women aren't interested in science. *You* aren't interested in science. And if you are, you're an aberration. Not normal, not accepted.

What I find interesting is that these statements came from the same person who, when the topic of implementing an option for the "third gender" in a form on one of our websites arose a few weeks earlier, rolled his eyes and asked whether people had nothing better to do than to make a fuss about that sort of thing. Another acquaintance spoke disparagingly about people who don't "want to choose" one of the options generally considered acceptable. "First World Problems," someone said.

I tried to explain that, the way I understand it, the point of legally requiring a third option isn't to pander to the wishes of some random, overly politically correct members of society who lack proper hobbies, but to address the issue of discrimination against people who aren't comfortable with their biological gender, don't identify with either gender, or even have physical characteristics of both genders.

I absolutely agree that a third option in a select-box in some online shop isn't going to solve the issue, but perhaps it will help draw attention to the problem, so that the affected people can be recognized and someday accepted as what they are: Human beings worthy of respect. Discrimination won't disappear over night, but at least this is a step in the right direction.

Their reaction to my explanation, however, rendered me speechless:

"What discrimination?"

I honestly didn't know what to say to that. The idea that *anyone* might think there was no discrimination against gender-queer people was absolutely incomprehensible to me.

"Sure, in America," he added. "But not here."

Not here? In Catholic Bavaria? Is that a joke?

Dear fellow human, in case you are reading this: I don't resent you personally because of what you said. I am no innocent and have, in all likelihood, allowed prejudice to influence my behaviour far more often than I realize - and in my ignorance hurt somebody or helped propagate social injustice.

But please listen to me, all the same:

I am sure that you do not think of yourself as sexist or as someone who discriminates against other people in any way. But you, as a heterosexual white male, will almost certainly never fully understand what it means to be a woman in this society, let alone someone who is queer or coloured.

Perhaps you are right in thinking that people who lament the small number of female Nobel Prize winners or advocate the legalization of a third gender are making a fuss for no reason, but how can you know that, without having experienced what they have?

As long as there are people who are treated differently because on their appearance, their religion, their sexual preferences or their biological or assumed gender, rather than exclusively because of how they treat their fellow humans - as long as there is a *single person* who even *feels* that this is the case - there is discrimination.

For those who aren't directly impacted, this discrimination is not always easy to recognize. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
