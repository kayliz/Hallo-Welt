I am at least 20 kilos overweight and have been for most of my adult life. I wanted to talk a bit about why that is and why I have a hard time losing weight.
This is very personal, but I have observed people who have made disparaging comments about other people’s bodies and been called out because of it justifying
their behaviour by saying that people who are overweight are an unnecessary burden on the healthcare system often enough that I feel this needs to be addressed.
For argument’s sake, I am going to assume that this justification is genuine.

For you to fully understand where I’m coming from, I need to tell you a bit about my past. My Mum has epilepsy and when I was in my early teens, she put on quite
a bit of weight very quickly due to her medication despite eating next to nothing. From what I remember, my father was neither supportive nor understanding and
when I started putting on weight, too, she was afraid for me and tried to get me to lose weight in the worst possible way: Through fat-shaming.

I was fourteen years old, about the same height as I am now and weighed 65 kilos. I did have a little too much fat on my belly, but that moved to my chest and
hips as I grew older, as it would have done even without any intervention. By the time I was 17, I had a figure which in retrospect was absolutely gorgeous.
I was certainly not overweight by any definition. But by then I did have an eating disorder.

You see, when my Mum started bullying me because of my weight, I really did try to lose some of it. I would go on a diet which I managed to keep up for a couple of
days, and then I would binge. I couldn’t help it. I felt like I had an empty hole inside of me which I could only fill by eating, and my shame at eating so much made
the hole bigger, which caused me to keep eating. Afterwards, I would try to “fix” it by going on an even stricter diet. For a while I also spent all my pocket money
on laxatives and when those turned out to be too expensive on the long run, I tried to make myself throw up.

I think on average, between the dieting and the binging, my weight stayed pretty much the same as it would have done if I had neither dieted nor binged. But now,
as an adult, I am very careful not to slip back into that old pattern.

Mostly, I try to lose weight through exercise. I currently exercise almost daily, on top of going everywhere by bicycle instead of by bus. Dieting, on the other hand,
is impossible. I can watch what I eat, and I can try to eat healthily, but if I deliberately try to reduce my calorie intake, I become obsessed. I literally cannot
go on a diet without my eating disorder returning.

But while it is possible for me to avoid becoming anorexic or bulimic, the binges are harder to control, particularly when I am stressed. I am more likely to overeat
if I feel bad, and I am more likely to feel bad if people around me are judging me because of my weight. This also works other way round: When I feel good, I almost
never get the urge to overeat. I also  find it easier to exercise. I lose weight almost without trying.

Basically, what I am getting at is that fat-shaming causes eating disorders and makes it harder to lose weight. What makes things worse is that bullying also causes
mental problems, and over the years, my mental problems have cost the healthcare system far more than my being overweight ever will. The people you are making fun of
or being horrible to probably already know that they are overweight and are either already doing something about it or struggling to for reasons that you, as an outsider,
can’t see, such as medication that makes them put on weight or an eating disorder or some other reason which never even occurred to you.

So if you actually care about not burdening the healthcare system, remember: Hate is always foolish, and love is always wise.
