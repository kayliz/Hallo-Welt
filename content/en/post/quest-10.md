*Set by Mum*

I completed this quest with Cali on the 28th of January 2019.

We had our operations in the afternoon and spend the next three and a half days in hospital before returning to my flat. Pain killers made the pain tolerable, and frequent visits by Ishmael, Bella, Marove and Mum helped distract us.
