*Set by Scara*

To complete this quest I organised a Burns Supper at the Binary Kitchen, with a lot of help.

Bevor the meal, I recited an excerpt of the "Address to a Haggis" and Cali did the "Selkirk Grace". The meal itself was vegetarian and non-vegetarian haggis with neeps and tatties and a delicious whisky sauce, and after that we had speeches: Bella did the "Immortal Memory", Magneto did the "Toast to the Lassies" and Ishmael did the "Reply to the Laddies".

Later there was a trifle made by Cali and cranachan made by Ishmael, and a lot of whisky, of which some came from the Whisky Kitchen and some was donated by generous paticipants. We laughed a lot and sang a lot, mostly Scottish folk songs, at first, but as the evening progressed and our alcohol levels increased we also sang other things, including Bohemian Rhapsody.

It was a wonderful evening and I would like to thank everyone who attended or helped, particularly Bella, Ishmael and Marove.
